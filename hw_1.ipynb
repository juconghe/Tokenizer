    "\n",
    "- What version of Python should I use? 2.7\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most of these questions require writing Python code and computing results, and the rest of them have textual answers. To generate the answers, you will have to fill out a supporting file, `hw_1.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For all of the textual answers you have to fill out have placeholder text which says \"Answer in one or two sentences here.\" For each question, you need to replace \"Answer in one or two sentences here\" with your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write all the answers in this ipython notebook. Once you are finished (1) Generate a PDF via (File -> Download As -> PDF) and upload to Gradescope (2)Turn in `hw_1.py` and `hw_1.ipynb` on Moodle.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Important:** Check your PDF before you turn it in to gradescope to make sure it exported correctly. If ipyhton notebook gets confused about your syntax it will sometimes terminate the PDF creation routine early. You are responsible for checking for these errors. If your whole PDF does not print, try running `$jupyter nbconvert --to pdf hw_1.ipynb` to identify and fix any syntax errors that might be causing problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Important:** When creating your final version of the PDF to hand in, please do a fresh restart and execute every cell in order. Then you'll be sure it's actually right. One convenient way to do this is by clicking `Cell -> Run All` in the notebook menu.\n",
    " \n",
    "- This assignment is designed so that you can run all cells in a few minutes of computation time. If it is taking longer than that, you probably have made a mistake in your code."

      "Right away, this film was ridiculous. Not that it didn't have redeeming aspects",
      " For example, the best thing about this film was the beautiful background scenery. Anyone not living on the East Coast should know the South doesn't have beautiful mountains like those found in the West. I knew it was Utah right off the bat, but perhaps Dalton couldn't suppress his English accent, so they had to excuse it by saying this was a southern town. Subverting his accent into a Southern one was easier. Sure the film has plot twists, but its phony sense of place was something I couldn't get past. It's not like Utah doesn't have meth labs... so why the writers thought it necessary to pretend it was in the South is beyond me. <br /><br />One other thing in action pictures always puzzles me. Why do they always make the \"cocking\" sound effect when the character pulls out an automatic handgun? It seemed every other sound effect in this movie was a \"chuk-chich\" signifying a 9mm was loaded and ready to fire. Of course, the weapons already had rounds chambered so this was unnecessary. <br /><br />Lastly, the pyrotechnics were WAY over the top. But hey, this film was targeted to a certain 'market segment' I suppose... It's too bad. Each of the actors can act, but this film was lame.\n"
